# Russian Wikipedia network analysis
*This project is dedicated to the creation of a directed network of Wikipedia pages and its analysis*

### Network Summary

- Network source and the description of preprocessing steps.
- Type of the graph: directed/undirected, heterogeneous/homogeneous, weighted/unweighted, etc.
- Node/Edge attributes.
- Number of nodes and edges.
- Diameter, radius.
- Clustering coefficient (global, average local, histogram).
- Average path length (histogram).
- Degree distribution, fitted models by regression/MLE/KS-test.
- Gorgeous network layout. Try to show that your network has some structure, play with node sizes and colors, scaling parameters. Tools like Gephi may be useful here.

### Structural Analysis

- The closest random graph model similar to your social network. Compare models from lectures, such as ER, BA, WS. Check real-world network properties on chosen random graph models and your network, compare the results.
- Degree/Closeness/Betweenness/Katz/Eigenvector centralities, top nodes description.
- Page-Rank/HITS in a case of directed network, top nodes description.
- Correlation comparison of centralities.
- Assortative mixing by node attributes and node degree.
- Node structural equivalence/similarity.

### Community Detection

- Clique search, k-cores visualization.
- Best results of various community detection algorithms, both in terms of interpretation and some quality criterion (modularity, silhouette, ground truth partition).
- The results should be visible on the network layout.
